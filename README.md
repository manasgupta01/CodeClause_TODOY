# CodeClause_TODOYA 
todo app is an application that allows users to create, manage, and organize their daily tasks and to-do lists. In your case, you have added a notes app feature to your todo app, which enables users to create and save notes along with their tasks.
To develop this app, you used Android Studio as the development environment and Java as the programming language. You also integrated Firebase, a backend-as-a-service platform, to store and retrieve user data, such as tasks and notes. With Firebase, users can synchronize their data across multiple devices and access it from anywhere with an internet connection.
Overall, your app provides a convenient and efficient way for users to keep track of their daily tasks and important notes in one place.
